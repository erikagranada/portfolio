# Conceptual content

## Introducing a platform banner

### Context

The HCL Connections 8.0 release introduced a new feature referred to as the “administrative banner”.

### Contribution

Working with the developer to craft the documentation, I mapped out the backbone of the content in the following manner, making sure to understand each facet of the feature in question:

I then reviewed, edited, and organised the developer’s Word draft into the following consumable formats:

[Administering the display of a site-wide banner ](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/connections-doc/v8/admin/admin/admin_banner_onprem.html) <br> A key element in documenting this feature was terminology. Internally, we called it the “administrative banner” because only administrators could control it. However, externally the term was meaningless, especially to new or beginner users. Another point was that “administrative” was a poor way of saying that the banner is available to administrators for enablement and configuration. Rather than go for the superfluous term, my lead and I decided that a descriptive title was best – it solved the problem of introducing the feature quickly, clarifying the user’s goal, and also allowed us to refer to the feature simply as the or a “banner”.

From the first article, I created two branches detailing the different approaches available to users: one through an app registry and the other using a system called Feature Foundation:
