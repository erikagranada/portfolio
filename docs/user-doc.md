# End-user documentation

## Refreshing a how-to guide for end-users

### Context

A user struggled to follow the step-by-step procedure for creating a Google Ads account, reporting that the content was confusing and inaccurate.

### Contribution

To understand the user’s perspective, I went through the sign-up process myself while reading through the help content. Doing so helped me map the true flow of the end-user interface, identify gaps in content, and plan my edit. I also gathered more information about product features this way.

The following table shows the state of the article before and after my edit.
