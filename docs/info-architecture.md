**SMEs**: Squad lead

## Problem

The documentation for HCL Connectionsâ€™ Communities app is large and disorderly, which makes it difficult for writers, developers, and customers to use and maintain the content.

In particular, these are the pain points:

- Cognitive load due to too much information too soon
- Users have to exert effort, reading, clicking, and scrolling to discover information without guidance
- Unclear grouping and information flow

Even developers felt discouraged by the format, stunting reviews.

## Solution and result

Through a card sorting and tree testing exercise, I streamlined the content categories and introduced a flow of user interactions through a high-level roadmap. I also stuck to the rule of progressive disclosure to help users achieve their goals and maximise product features. In the process, I removed content duplicates. For writers, this meant less overhead maintenance and risk of error.
